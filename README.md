My thoughts about the code structure for BookingController For me the code appears to be well-organized and follows some good practices.

List of the good things.
  * there using namespace to avoid conflicts of the same class and file name and keep the code modular.
  * there using a proper controller name  Like (BookingController)
  * There is also  a dependency injection for the Repository approach. Is a good practice as it promotes flexibility and testability.
  * They also use comments its very helpful so the other developer will be informed what method or function is.
  * also they use error handling. It might be more informative to log the error or return a more detailed response

In summary, the code seems well-structured, but there's always another way for improvement. Specially the coding standards, and team conventions when making changes.

list needs to improved.
  * It is good to follow some coding standards like PS-R
  * for using a boolean as a string like this  (e.g., $data['flagged'] == 'true')
  * Instead of using env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID') and env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID') directly in the code. it might be good to set it up into the config file and use config to get the value.
  * make sure to avoid code duplication



My thoughts about the code structure for BookingRepository  the code appears to be good for me an also it follows some good practices.

List of the good things.
  * They use namespace to avoid conflicts of the same class and file name and keep the code modular.
  * They use  PS-R coding standards  
  * They use a dependency injection for the model and other classes.

In summary, the code seems well-structured, but there's always another way for improvement. Specially the coding standards, and team conventions when making changes.

list needs to improved.
  * Don't put too much code into the method or function. it might be difficult for the other developers to read and understand
  * Use a scope for the model or any feature from a model like services, relationships, etc.;
  * Make a reusable code because this one is redundant (return ['success', 'Changes saved']).
  * put 'SpecificJob' on a model as a constant and call it you need  to avoid redundancy and easily update the  value.
  * Same on the BookingController of using  env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID') directly in the code. it might be good to set it up into the config file and use config to get the value.
  * Avoid Redundant codes, (e.g Carbon::now(), etc). you can put this on variable and call it if you need to.
